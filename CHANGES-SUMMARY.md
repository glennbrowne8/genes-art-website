# ✅ Customizable Page Content - Summary

## What I Just Added

Gene can now customize **ALL text on the website** through a new admin panel section!

## What Changed

### 1. New CMS Section: "Page Content"
Located at: `yoursite.com/admin` → Site Settings → **Page Content**

### 2. What Gene Can Now Customize:

#### Contact Page
- Section title
- Commission Work heading & text
- Delivery & Shipping heading & text

#### Gallery Page  
- Section title
- Empty gallery message

#### About Section
- Section title

#### Footer
- Footer text

### 3. Files Modified/Created:

✅ **`public/admin/config.yml`** - Added Page Content configuration
✅ **`content/settings/page-content.json`** - Created with default content
✅ **`app/page.js`** - Updated to read from page-content.json
✅ **`app/globals.css`** - Already updated (About section styling from earlier)

## How to Deploy These Changes

```bash
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site

# Test locally first (optional)
npm run dev

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Added customizable page content and updated About styling"
git push
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for Netlify to rebuild, then Gene will see the new "Page Content" option!

## In the Admin Panel

Gene will now see:
- **Site Settings**
  - General Settings (contact info, hero, about)

4. **Special promotions** - Add temporary messages about sales or events
