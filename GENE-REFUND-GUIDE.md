G'day Gene! If a customer needs their money back for an artwork, follow these simple steps.

### Step 1: Log in to Stripe
1. Go to [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) and log in.
2. Click on **"Payments"** in the top menu.

### Step 2: Find the Customer's Payment
1. Look through the list of payments to find the person you need to refund.
2. Click on their **Name** or the **Amount** to open the payment details.

### Step 3: Issue the Refund
1. Look for the **Refund** button at the top right of the page and click it.
2. **Reason:** Select "Requested by customer" (or whatever fits).
3. **Amount:** 
   - To give all the money back, leave it as the full amount.
   - To keep some money (like the shipping cost), type in a smaller amount.
4. Click the purple **Refund** button.

*Stripe will automatically email the customer to tell them the money is on its way. It usually takes 5 to 10 days to show up in their bank account.*

### Step 4: Update the Website (Crucial!)
Because the website doesn't know you did a refund, you need to manually put the artwork back up for sale if you still have it.

1. Log in to your website **Admin Panel** (the CMS).
2. Find the artwork you just refunded.
3. Change the **Available** switch back to **ON** (Green).
4. Click **Save/Publish**.

### 💡 Good to Know
- **Fees:** Stripe usually keeps the small transaction fee (a few dollars) when you refund, so you might be out of pocket by a tiny amount.
- **Support:** If you get stuck, you can always ask your developer for help!
