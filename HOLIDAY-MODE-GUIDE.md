# 🏖️ Holiday Mode - User Guide for Gene

## What is Holiday Mode?

Holiday Mode is a simple feature that lets you temporarily pause new orders when you're away on holidays, leave, or taking a break. Your gallery stays visible so customers can browse, but they'll see a friendly message letting them know when you'll be back.
