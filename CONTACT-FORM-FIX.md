# Contact Form Fix for Netlify Forms

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed "Ask a Question" Button
**File:** `app/components/ArtworkActions.js`

- Removed the "Ask a Question" button from both available and sold artwork
- Removed the ContactModal import and functionality
- Now only shows "Available" or "Out of Stock" status

### 2. ✅ Fixed Netlify Forms Integration
**Files Modified:**
- `app/layout.js` - Added hidden form for Netlify detection
- `app/components/ContactForm.js` - Cleaned up form attributes

**What Was Wrong:**
Netlify Forms requires a static HTML form to exist in your built HTML files. When using React/Next.js with client-side rendering, Netlify can't detect the form during the build process.

**The Solution:**
Added a hidden form in `layout.js` that Netlify can detect during build:
```html
<form name="contact" netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="tel" name="phone" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
</form>
```

This acts as a "template" that tells Netlify "Hey, there's a form called 'contact' on this site!"

## Next Steps - Deploy to Netlify

### Step 1: Build and Test Locally
```bash
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site
npm run build
npm run start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and test:
- ✅ "Ask a Question" button is gone
- ✅ Contact form at bottom of page is visible

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Remove Ask a Question button and fix Netlify Forms"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Netlify Will Auto-Deploy
- Netlify will detect the push and rebuild your site
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the build to complete

### Step 4: Verify Forms Are Working in Netlify

1. **Check Forms Dashboard**
   - Log into Netlify
   - Go to your site
   - Click on "Forms" in the left sidebar
   - You should see "contact" form listed

2. **Test the Form**
   - Go to your live site
   - Scroll to the Contact section
   - Fill out and submit the form
   - Check Netlify Forms dashboard for the submission
