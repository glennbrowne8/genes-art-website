# üîß Netlify Forms Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnostic Checklist

### 1. Check if Form Appears in Netlify Dashboard
‚úÖ **Go to:** Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Forms  
‚úÖ **Look for:** "contact" form should be listed  

**If NOT listed:**
- The form wasn't detected during build
- Follow "Form Not Detected" section below

**If listed:**
- Good! Form is detected, issue is with submission
- Follow "Form Detected But Not Working" section below

---

## Problem 1: Form Not Detected in Netlify

### Symptoms:
- No "contact" form in Netlify Forms dashboard
- Form tab shows "No forms detected"

### Solution Steps:

#### Step 1: Verify Hidden Form Exists
Check `app/layout.js` has this:
```jsx
<form 
  name="contact" 
  data-netlify="true" 
  data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field" 
  hidden
>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="tel" name="phone" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
</form>
```

#### Step 2: Rebuild with Cache Clear
In Netlify:
1. Go to: **Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy**
2. Click: **Trigger deploy**
3. Select: **Clear cache and deploy site**
4. Wait for build to complete (2-3 min)
5. Check Forms tab again

#### Step 3: Check Build Logs
If still not working:
1. Go to: **Deploys** tab
2. Click on latest deploy
3. Scroll through build logs
4. Look for errors related to forms

---

## Problem 2: Form Detected But Submissions Not Working

### Symptoms:
- "contact" form appears in Netlify dashboard
- Submitting form shows error message
- Or form submits but nothing happens

### Diagnostic Test:

#### Open Browser Console
1. Open your live site
2. Press **F12** (or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Try submitting the form
5. Look for red error messages

### Common Issues & Solutions:

#### Issue A: 404 Error
**Error in console:** `POST / 404 (Not Found)`

**Cause:** Form is trying to POST to wrong URL

**Solution:** 
The form should POST to `/` which is correct. This might be a Netlify routing issue.

Try adding this to your `netlify.toml` file (create it if it doesn't exist):
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

#### Issue B: CORS Error
**Error in console:** `CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`

**Cause:** Security restriction

**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with Netlify Forms. If you see this, the form isn't configured correctly.

#### Issue C: Form Name Mismatch
**Error in console:** Form not found

**Cause:** Form name in submission doesn't match Netlify

**Solution:** Verify these match exactly:
- Hidden form in `layout.js`: `name="contact"`
- ContactForm component: form name should be `contact`
- Form submission: `'form-name': 'contact'`

All must be identical (case-sensitive)!

## Testing the Form Manually

### Test 1: Check Form HTML
1. Open your live site
2. Right-click on the contact form
3. Click "Inspect Element"
4. Verify you see:
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact">
  <!-- other fields -->
</form>
```

### Test 2: Manual Submission
Try submitting using browser console:

1. Open live site
2. Press F12
3. Go to Console tab
4. Paste this code:
```javascript
fetch('/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    'form-name': 'contact',
    'name': 'Test User',
    'email': 'test@example.com',
    'phone': '0400000000',
    'message': 'This is a test message'
  }).toString()
})
.then(response => console.log('Response:', response.status))
.catch(error => console.error('Error:', error))
```

**Expected result:** 
- Console shows: `Response: 200` or `Response: 303`
- Submission appears in Netlify dashboard

**If error:**
- Note the error message
- Check what status code you get
- Look in Network tab for details

---

## Check Netlify Configuration

### Verify Build Settings
In Netlify Dashboard:
1. Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy ‚Üí Build settings
2. Verify:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `out`
   - **Node version:** 18 or higher

### Check Environment
- Go to: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment variables
- Make sure no conflicting variables

---

## Check Next.js Configuration

### Verify next.config.js
Your `next.config.js` should have:
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå Mistake 1: Using Wrong Attributes
```jsx
// WRONG - React doesn't recognize these
<form netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field">

// CORRECT - Use data- prefix
<form data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field">
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 2: Missing Hidden Input
```jsx
// WRONG - No form-name input
<form name="contact" method="POST" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  
// CORRECT - Has hidden form-name input
<form name="contact" method="POST" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
  <input type="text" name="name" />
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 3: Form Name Mismatch
```jsx
// Hidden form says "contact"
<form name="contact" data-netlify="true" hidden>

// But submission says "contactForm" - MISMATCH!
body: new URLSearchParams({
  'form-name': 'contactForm',  // ‚ùå WRONG
```

### ‚ùå Mistake 4: Not Using FormData
```javascript
// LESS RELIABLE - Manually building data
body: new URLSearchParams({
  'form-name': 'contact',
  name: formState.name,
  email: formState.email,
  // etc...
}).toString()

// BETTER - Let FormData do the work
const formData = new FormData(e.target)
body: new URLSearchParams(formData).toString()
```

## What Should Happen When Working

### 1. Before Submit:
- Form is visible on page
- All fields are empty or have user input
- Submit button is enabled

### 2. During Submit:

- Button is disabled
- Network request goes out (check Network tab)

### 3. After Successful Submit:
- Green success message appears
- Form fields are cleared
- Submission appears in Netlify dashboard
- Email notification sent (if configured)

### 4. If Error:
- Red error message appears
- Form data is preserved
- Console shows error details

## Step-by-Step Debug Process

### Phase 1: Confirm Detection
1. ‚úÖ Push code to GitHub
2. ‚úÖ Netlify rebuilds automatically
3. ‚úÖ Check Netlify Forms dashboard
4. ‚úÖ "contact" form listed? 
   - YES ‚Üí Go to Phase 2
   - NO ‚Üí Trigger cache clear and rebuild

### Phase 2: Test Submission
1. ‚úÖ Open live site in incognito window
2. ‚úÖ Open browser console (F12)
3. ‚úÖ Fill out form with test data
4. ‚úÖ Click Submit
5. ‚úÖ Watch console for errors
6. ‚úÖ Check Network tab for POST request
7. ‚úÖ What's the status code?
   - 200 or 303 ‚Üí SUCCESS!
   - 404 ‚Üí Form not found (check form name)
   - 500 ‚Üí Server error (check Netlify logs)
   - Other ‚Üí Note error and investigate

### Phase 3: Verify Receipt
1. ‚úÖ Check Netlify Forms dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Is submission listed?
   - YES ‚Üí Form works! Set up notifications
   - NO ‚Üí Check Netlify logs for errors

## Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Clear Everything and Redeploy
```bash
# 1. Delete .next and out folders
rm -rf .next out

# 2. Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build locally to test
npm run build

# 4. If successful, push
git add .
git commit -m "Rebuild for Netlify Forms"
git push
```

### Fix 2: Add netlify.toml
Create `netlify.toml` in project root:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "out"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### Fix 3: Simplify Form (Test)
Create a super simple test form to verify Netlify works:

In `app/page.js`, temporarily add:
```jsx
<form name="test" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="test" />
  <input type="text" name="name" required />
  <button type="submit">Test Submit</button>
</form>
```

If this works but ContactForm doesn't, the issue is in ContactForm.js

## Still Not Working?

### Try Alternative Approach:
If Netlify Forms keeps failing, you can use:

1. **Formspree** (free alternative)
   - 50 submissions/month free
   - Easier to set up
   - Works with any form

2. **EmailJS** (JavaScript solution)
   - 200 emails/month free
   - Sends directly from browser
   - No backend needed

3. **Contact via mailto link** (fallback)
   - Always works
   - Opens user's email client
   - Not as nice but functional

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ‚úÖ Form in Netlify dashboard
- ‚úÖ Test submission succeeds
- ‚úÖ Submission appears in dashboard
- ‚úÖ Console shows no errors
- ‚úÖ Success message displays
- ‚úÖ Email notification received (if set up)

## Pro Tips

1. **Always test in incognito window** - Avoids cache issues
2. **Check Network tab** - Shows exactly what's being sent
3. **Use test data** - Don't spam Gene's email during testing
4. **Screenshot errors** - Helps with troubleshooting
5. **Check Netlify status** - Maybe Netlify itself is down: status.netlify.com
