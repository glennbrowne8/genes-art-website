# 🎨 Gene's Website Guide

Hello Gene! This guide shows you how to manage your art website.

**Important:** You don't need to know any computer code. Everything is done through a simple "Admin Panel" that looks like a form.

2.  Go to your website address followed by `/admin`.

3.  Enter your email and password.

## 💰 2. CRITICAL: What to do when you Sell Art

**Your website does not automatically mark items as "Sold". You must do this.**

When someone buys a painting, here is what happens:
1.  **You get an email** from Stripe saying "Payment Received."
2.  **You must log in** to the website immediately to stop someone else from buying it.

### Step-by-Step: Marking an Item as "Sold"
1.  Log in to the Admin Panel.
2.  Click **"Artwork"** on the left menu.
3.  Click on the painting that was just sold.
4.  Find the switch that says **"Available"**.
5.  Click it so it turns **OFF** (Grey).
6.  Click the **"Publish"** button at the top.
7.  **Done!** It will now show as "Sold" on the website.

## 🖼️ 3. Adding New Artwork

2.  Click **"Artwork"** on the left menu.
3.  Click the blue **"New Artwork"** button.

    *   **Title:** The name of the piece.
    *   **Category:** Choose from the list (Clay, Drawings, etc.).
    *   **Description:** A short story about the piece.
    *   **Price:** Just the number (e.g., `50`).
    *   **Image:** Click to upload a photo from your computer.
    *   **Dimensions:** (Optional) e.g., "50cm x 30cm".
    *   **Weight:** (Optional) e.g., "2.5" (used for shipping calculations).
