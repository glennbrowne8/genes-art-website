## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Stripe Package (5 minutes)

```powershell
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site
npm install
```

This will install the Stripe package and all dependencies.

---

### Step 2: Get Stripe API Keys (15 minutes)

#### Option A: Use Test Mode First (Recommended)

1. **Go to** https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. **Create account** (if Gene doesn't have one yet)
3. **Toggle to TEST MODE** (switch in dashboard - top left)
4. **Get API keys:**
   - Click "Developers" → "API keys"
   - Copy **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)
   - Copy **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`)

#### Option B: Use Production Mode (After Testing)

Same steps as above, but keep toggle on **LIVE MODE**
- Keys will start with `pk_live_...` and `sk_live_...`

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (5 minutes)

Create a file called `.env.local` in the project root:

```powershell
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site
notepad .env.local
```

Paste this content (replace with YOUR keys):

```env
# Stripe Keys
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Gene's email (for notifications)
GENE_EMAIL=gene@example.com
```

**Replace:**
- `pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your actual Stripe publishable key
- `sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE` with your actual Stripe secret key
- `gene@example.com` with Gene's real email

**Save and close** the file.

**IMPORTANT:** Never commit `.env.local` to Git! It contains secret keys.

---

### Step 4: Test Locally (10 minutes)

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

#### Test the Checkout Flow:

1. **Scroll to Gallery**
2. **Click "Buy Now"** on any artwork
3. **Select shipping option** (try pickup first)
4. **Click "Proceed to Payment"**
5. **You'll be redirected to Stripe Checkout**
6. **Use Stripe test card:**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - Name: Test Customer
   - Email: your email
7. **Complete purchase**
8. **You'll see the success page!**
9. **Check Stripe Dashboard** → Payments (you'll see the test payment!)

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Shipping Rates

Edit: `app/components/CheckoutModal.js`

Find the `SHIPPING_OPTIONS` array (lines 4-32) and modify prices:

```javascript
const SHIPPING_OPTIONS = [
  {
    id: 'pickup',
    label: '🏠 Pickup (Earlville, QLD)',
    description: 'Free pickup from our studio...',
    price: 0, // Keep as 0 for FREE
    priceLabel: 'FREE'
  },
  {
    id: 'local',
    label: '🚗 Local Delivery',
    description: 'Within 50km of Cairns...',
    price: 1000, // $10.00 in cents (change to 1500 for $15, etc.)
    priceLabel: '$10.00' // Update label to match
  },
  // ... etc
]
```

**Remember:** Prices are in CENTS (100 cents = $1)

### Add More Shipping Options

Add new entries to the `SHIPPING_OPTIONS` array:

```javascript
{
  id: 'overnight',
  label: '⚡ Overnight Delivery',
  description: 'Next business day delivery',
  price: 6500, // $65.00
  priceLabel: '$65.00'
}
```

### Change Success Page Message

Edit: `app/success/page.js`

Update the content in the JSX to match your preferences.
