# 📦 Shipping Insurance Feature - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Added

Your site now has **optional shipping insurance** integrated into the checkout process! Customers can choose to protect their artwork purchase during transit.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Customer Experience:

1. **Clicks "Available" button** on artwork they want
2. **Checkout modal opens** showing:
   - Artwork summary
   - Delivery method options (Pickup, Local, Standard, Express)
   - **NEW: Shipping Insurance checkbox** 📦
   - Price breakdown
3. **Can check insurance box** to add coverage
4. **Price updates automatically** when insurance is selected
5. **Proceeds to Stripe** payment with all items clearly shown

---

## 💰 Insurance Pricing

**Automatic calculation:**
```
Insurance Cost = MAX(10% of artwork price, $15 minimum)
```

### Examples:

| Artwork Price | Insurance Cost | Calculation |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| $50 | $15.00 | 10% = $5, but minimum is $15 |
| $100 | $15.00 | 10% = $10, but minimum is $15 |
| $150 | $15.00 | 10% = $15 |
| $300 | $30.00 | 10% = $30 |
| $450 | $45.00 | 10% = $45 |
| $1,000 | $100.00 | 10% = $100 |

**Why 10%?**
- Industry standard for valuable items
- Covers typical insurance costs from couriers
- Fair pricing for both customer and Gene

**Why $15 minimum?**
- Covers base insurance policy costs
- Makes sense for lower-priced items
- Prevents extremely low insurance fees

## 📊 What Gene Sees in Stripe

When a customer purchases with insurance, Stripe Dashboard shows:

### Line Items:
```
1. [Artwork Title]           $450.00
2. 📦 Standard Shipping      $20.00
3. 📦 Shipping Insurance     $45.00
   ──────────────────────────────────
   Total:                    $515.00
```

### Metadata:
```
artworkId: "ned-kelly-portrait"
artworkTitle: "Ned Kelly Portrait"
shippingOption: "standard"
shippingLabel: "📦 Standard Shipping"
includeInsurance: "yes"
insuranceAmount: "45.00"
```

**Gene can clearly see:**
- ✅ If customer selected insurance
- ✅ How much insurance was charged
- ✅ Which artwork was purchased
- ✅ Which shipping method selected
- ✅ Customer contact details
- ✅ Shipping address

   - Pay with collected insurance fee

2. **Private Courier Insurance:**

   - FedEx, DHL, TNT have coverage

   - Check with local insurance providers

**Best Practice:**
- For items >$200: **Always insure** (even if customer declines)
- Use collected fee to pay for actual coverage
- Keep proof of insurance with tracking number
- Insure for **full replacement value**

## 💡 Customization Options

### Change Insurance Percentage:

```javascript
// Change from 10% to 15%:
const insurancePrice = includeInsurance 
  ? Math.max(Math.round(artworkPrice * 0.15), 1500)
  : 0

// Or 5%:
const insurancePrice = includeInsurance 
  ? Math.max(Math.round(artworkPrice * 0.05), 1500)
  : 0
```

### Change Minimum Fee:

```javascript
// Change from $15 to $20 minimum:
const insurancePrice = includeInsurance 
  ? Math.max(Math.round(artworkPrice * 0.10), 2000) // $20
  : 0
```

### Make Insurance Required:

```javascript
// Remove checkbox, always include it:
const includeInsurance = true // Force it on
const insurancePrice = Math.max(Math.round(artworkPrice * 0.10), 1500)

// Remove the checkbox UI section
// Price will always include insurance
```

### Change Insurance Description:

**File:** `CheckoutModal.js` (line ~165)
