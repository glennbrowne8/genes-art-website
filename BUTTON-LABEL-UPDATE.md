### For Gene:

3. Checkout modal opens
4. Selects shipping
5. Proceeds to payment
6. Completes purchase
```

### Customer Sees Sold Item:
```
1. Sees gray "Out of Stock" button
2. Knows immediately it's unavailable
3. Can still click "Ask a Question"

   - When it will be back in stock
   - Custom orders
   - Similar pieces
   - Waitlist
```

## 💬 Copy Changes

### Old Copy:
- "💳 Buy Now" - Transaction-focused
- "SOLD" - All caps, aggressive

### New Copy:
- "✅ Available" - Status-focused
- "Out of Stock" - Softer, standard e-commerce language

**Reasoning:**
- "Available" is less pushy than "Buy Now"
- "Out of Stock" suggests it might come back
- More professional, standard language
- Reduces purchase anxiety

---

## 🔄 CMS Behavior (Gene's Side)

### Nothing Changes for Gene!

Gene still just toggles the "Available" switch in the CMS:

**Available = ON:**
- Website shows "✅ Available" button
- Customers can purchase

**Available = OFF:**
- Website shows "Out of Stock" button
- Customers can inquire

**Same simple process!**

---

## 🎨 Color Psychology

### Green (Available):
- ✅ Positive, affirmative
- ✅ "Go" signal
- ✅ Common for "in stock" across e-commerce
- ✅ Creates urgency (available now!)

### Gray (Out of Stock):
- ⚫ Neutral, passive
- ⚫ "Stopped" signal
- ⚫ Common for unavailable items
- ⚫ Reduces frustration (clearly disabled)

---

## 📱 Mobile View

Both buttons stack vertically on mobile:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  [Photo]            │
│                     │
│  Title              │
│  $100 AUD           │
│                     │
│ ┌─────────────────┐ │
│ │  ✅ Available   │ │
│ └─────────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────────┐ │
│ │  ✉️ Ask Question│ │
│ └─────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────┘
```

Works perfectly on all screen sizes!
