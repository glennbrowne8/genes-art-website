## 💰 How It Works

**Pricing:** Insurance = MAX(10% of artwork price, $15)

**Examples:**
- $100 artwork → $15 insurance
- $450 artwork → $45 insurance
- $1,000 artwork → $100 insurance

**What customers see:**
1. Open checkout modal
2. See insurance checkbox: "📦 Add Shipping Insurance +$XX.XX"
3. Check box if they want it
4. Total updates automatically
5. Proceed to Stripe (insurance as separate line item)

**What Gene sees in Stripe:**
- Line item: "📦 Shipping Insurance - $45.00"
- Metadata: `includeInsurance: yes`
- Metadata: `insuranceAmount: 45.00`

## 🧪 Testing

### Right now (without deploying):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Click "Available" on any artwork
2. Check the insurance checkbox
3. Watch total price update
4. Click "Proceed to Payment"
5. Should see insurance in Stripe checkout

**Use Stripe test card:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`

## 🚀 Deploy When Ready

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added optional shipping insurance"
git push
```

Netlify will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes!

## ⚠️ Important Note

**This collects the insurance FEE** - Gene still needs to purchase actual insurance coverage when shipping (Australia Post, courier, or annual policy). Use the collected fee to pay for it.

**Best practice:** For items >$200, always insure (even if customer declines).
