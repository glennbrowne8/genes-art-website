# 💳 Stripe Payment Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ What's New

Your Gene's Australian Art website now has **integrated Stripe payment links**! This allows customers to purchase artwork directly while maintaining the simplicity Gene needs.

---

## 🌟 How It Works

### For Gene (The Artist)

**Option 1: Sell with Stripe Payment** (Customer buys instantly)
1. Create payment link in Stripe dashboard
2. Add artwork to website via CMS
3. Paste Stripe link in "Stripe Payment Link" field
4. Customer clicks "Buy Now" → Secure checkout → Money in bank!

**Option 2: Inquiry-Based** (Customer contacts first)
1. Add artwork to website via CMS
2. Leave "Stripe Payment Link" field empty
3. Customer clicks "Inquire About This Piece"
4. Gene arranges payment method (bank transfer, PayPal, etc.)

**Flexibility**: Gene can mix both! Some pieces with Buy Now, others with inquiry only.

---

## ðŸ› ï¸ Technical Implementation

### What Was Added

1. **CMS Field**: New "Stripe Payment Link" field in artwork editor
2. **Buy Now Button**: Prominent button when payment link is present
3. **Inquire Button**: Always available for customer questions
4. **Contact Modal**: Popup form for inquiries
5. **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on mobile
6. **Smart Display**: Automatically shows right buttons based on availability
