### Important Notes for Handmade Art

1. **Natural Variations**: Each piece is unique. Minor variations in color, texture, and appearance are normal.
2. **Photos**: Colors may appear different on screens.
3. **Outdoor Items**: Corrugated iron paintings will naturally weather over time. This is not a defect.
4. **Fragile Items**: Clay art and framed drawings are fragile. Inspect immediately upon delivery.
