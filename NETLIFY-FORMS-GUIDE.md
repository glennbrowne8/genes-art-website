## What Gene Will Receive

When someone submits the contact form, Gene gets an email like this:

```
From: Netlify Forms
To: gene@example.com
Subject: New form submission - contact

New submission from contact form:

Name: John Smith
Email: john.smith@example.com
Phone: 0412345678
Message: Hi Gene, I'm interested in the Ned Kelly painting. 
Is it still available? Can you provide more details about 
the dimensions and shipping options?

View submission: [Link to Netlify]
```

---

## Form Spam Protection

Your form has built-in spam protection:

1. **Honeypot Field**
   - Hidden field that bots fill out but humans don't see
   - Netlify automatically rejects submissions with honeypot filled

2. **reCAPTCHA (Optional)**
   If you start getting spam:
   - Go to Forms settings
   - Enable reCAPTCHA
   - Get free reCAPTCHA keys from Google
   - Add them to Netlify

---

## Monthly Limits

**Free Tier:** 100 submissions/month

**If you exceed:**
- Forms still work
- Submissions stored for 30 days (vs. 1 year on free)
- Pay $19/month for Level 1 (1,000 submissions)

**For Gene's site:** 100/month is plenty
- That's ~3 inquiries per day
- More than enough for an art business

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Form Not Showing in Netlify Dashboard

**Cause:** Netlify didn't detect the form during build

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Rebuild with cache clear
# In Netlify: Site Settings â†’ Build & Deploy â†’ Trigger deploy â†’ Clear cache

# Option 2: Verify hidden form exists in layout.js
# Should have this in app/layout.js:
<form name="contact" netlify="true" netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="tel" name="phone" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
</form>
```

### Problem: Form Submits But Shows Error

**Cause:** Form name mismatch

**Solution:**
- Check ContactForm.js has: `name="contact"`
- Check layout.js hidden form has: `name="contact"`
- Both must match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Problem: No Email Notifications

**Cause:** Email notifications not configured

**Solution:**
1. Forms â†’ contact â†’ Form notifications
2. Add notification
3. Enter Gene's correct email
4. Check spam folder for test emails

### Problem: Form Submits But Nothing Happens

**Cause:** JavaScript error or network issue

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+F5)

### Problem: Getting Spam Submissions

**Solution:**
1. Enable reCAPTCHA in Netlify Forms settings
2. Add custom spam filters
3. Use Akismet integration (paid add-on)

---

## Alternative: Slack Notifications

Instead of email, send to Slack:

1. Forms â†’ contact â†’ Form notifications
2. Add notification â†’ Slack notification
3. Connect your Slack workspace
4. Choose channel (e.g., #artwork-inquiries)
5. Save

Now form submissions appear in Slack!

---

## Custom Success Message

Want to customize what customers see after submitting?

**Option 1: Current inline message**
- Shows green success box on same page
- Keeps customer on your site
- âœ… Good for user experience

**Option 2: Redirect to thank-you page**
1. Create a "Thank You" page
2. In ContactForm.js, add after successful submission:
```javascript
window.location.href = '/thank-you'
```

---

## Viewing All Submissions

**In Netlify Dashboard:**
1. Forms â†’ contact
2. See all submissions in chronological order
3. Click any submission to see details
4. Export to CSV if needed

**Data Included:**
- Submission date/time
- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Message
- IP address (for spam prevention)

---

## Form Submission Workflow

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:

1. **Customer fills form** (on your website)
2. **JavaScript handles submit** (ContactForm.js)
3. **Data sent to Netlify** (via POST request)
4. **Netlify validates data** (checks honeypot, stores in database)
5. **Netlify sends notification** (email to Gene)
6. **Customer sees success message** (green box on page)
7. **Gene responds** (via email/phone to customer)

---

## Best Practices

### For Gene:

âœ… **Check email daily** for form submissions
âœ… **Respond within 24 hours** (better customer experience)
âœ… **Add customers to mailing list** (if you create one later)
âœ… **Track inquiries** (helps understand what sells)

### For You (Admin):

âœ… **Test monthly** to ensure forms still work
âœ… **Monitor submission count** (check if nearing 100/month)
âœ… **Watch for spam** (enable reCAPTCHA if needed)
âœ… **Update email address** if Gene changes email
