## 🎯 How It Works

### When Gene Enables Holiday Mode:

1. **Top of website**: Sticky banner appears with:
   - 🏖️ Beach emoji
   - "Currently Away" heading
   - Custom or default message
   - Return date (if set)

2. **Gallery section**: 
   - All artwork still visible
   - Prices still shown
   - "Buy Now" buttons hidden
   - Shows: "💬 Contact me when I return to purchase"

3. **Contact section**:
   - Phone and email still visible
   - Contact form replaced with message:
     - "📧 Contact form temporarily unavailable"
     - "You can still reach me via phone or email..."

### When Gene Disables Holiday Mode:

Everything returns to normal:
- Banner disappears
- "Buy Now" buttons return
- Contact form works again

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Test Locally First:

```bash
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify:
- ✅ Site loads without errors
- ✅ No console errors in browser

### 2. Test Holiday Mode:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. Login with your credentials
3. Navigate to **Site Settings** → **General Settings**
4. Scroll to **Holiday Mode** (should be collapsed)

7. (Optional) Set a test return date (e.g., tomorrow)
8. (Optional) Add a custom message
9. Click **"Publish"**
10. Wait ~30 seconds (local is fast)
11. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a new tab
12. You should see:
    - ✅ Orange/cream banner at top
    - ✅ "Currently Away" message
    - ✅ Your return date (if you set one)
    - ✅ "Contact me when I return" in gallery
    - ✅ Contact form disabled

### 3. Test Disabling:

1. Go back to admin panel
2. Toggle **"Enable Holiday Mode"** to **OFF**
3. Click **"Publish"**
4. Wait ~30 seconds
5. Refresh main site
6. Banner should be gone
7. Everything back to normal

## 🚀 Deploy to Production

Once you've tested locally and everything works:

```bash
cd C:\scripts\genes-art-site
git add .
git commit -m "Add Holiday Mode feature for temporary store closure"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically deploy in 2-3 minutes.

### After Deployment:

1. Visit your live site's `/admin`
2. Test enabling/disabling holiday mode
3. Verify it works on the live site
4. Show Gene how to use it!

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Component Architecture:

**HolidayBanner.js** (Client Component)
- Reads `settings.holidayMode` object
- Returns null if not enabled (no render)
- Formats date in Australian locale
- Sticky positioning at top of page

**page.js** (Server Component)
- Reads settings during build
- Passes to HolidayBanner
- Checks `isHolidayMode` boolean
- Conditionally renders Buy buttons vs holiday message

### Data Flow:
1. Gene toggles in CMS → saves to `general.json`
2. Git commit → triggers Netlify build
3. Next.js reads `general.json` during build
4. Components check holiday mode status
5. Render appropriate UI
