# ✅ Return Policy Links Added!

## What Was Added

### 1. Navigation Link (Top Menu)
**Location:** `app/page.js` - Line 90

Added "Returns Policy" link to the main navigation menu at the top of the page.

```jsx
<li><a href="/returns-refunds">Returns Policy</a></li>
```

**Benefits:**
- Always visible at top of page
- Easy for customers to find
- Professional appearance

---

### 2. Footer Link
**Location:** `app/page.js` - Lines 202-205

Added a short summary with link in the footer:

```jsx
<p style={{ marginTop: '0.5rem', fontSize: '0.9rem' }}>
  Returns accepted within 7 days for damaged/defective items. 
  <a href="/returns-refunds">View Full Returns Policy</a>
</p>
```

**Benefits:**
- Standard location for policies
- Visible on every page
- Quick reference for customers

### 3. Return Policy Page
**Location:** `app/returns-refunds/page.js` (NEW)

Created a dedicated page that:
- ✅ Displays the return policy from markdown
- ✅ Matches the site's design
- ✅ Has its own navigation
- ✅ Includes "Back to Gallery" button
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### 4. Added Dependency
**Location:** `package.json`

Added `marked` package for rendering markdown to HTML.

**Action Required:** Run `npm install` to install the new package.

## How It Works

- Homepage: `yoursite.com/`
- Return Policy: `yoursite.com/returns-refunds/`

### Content Flow:
1. Customer clicks "Returns Policy" link
2. Loads `/returns-refunds/` page
3. Reads markdown from `content/pages/returns-refunds.md`
4. Converts to HTML and displays
5. Gene can edit via CMS anytime!
